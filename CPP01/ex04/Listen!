It’s deep deep, deep in my heart
In the sanctuary where nothing echoed
heat heat, it caught on fire, so I can’t return
It’s shock shock, a shock that I send you
Saying, “Hey, let’s go everywhere together”
rock rock, the storm and tsunami of sound lure each other

A dropped pick, a broken stick
Aren’t problems at all
We’re within the same sound, and that’s actually a miracle

We’ll sing, we’ll sing as long as we feel like it
No matter how quiet it is, it’s our single song in the world
I want to live with all my might
So much that I won’t regret it even if I die today
Release, passionate
This is a PRECIOUS Heart Beat of ours
We’ll sing

Non sweet, sweet, your true nature is more comfortable
Than sweet words, right? Touch of mind, yeah
wit wit, it’d be fun to tell me, always and forever
Non stop stop, because my newborn feelings
Are hurrying faster than light
rock rock, I’ve got to catch them with sound and tell them to you

A running rhythm, a crazed tuning
Are all within my assumption
I’m choosing the same dream, and that’s the power for tomorrow

We’ll shout, we’ll shout even if we’re on an away stage
Because no matter how scared we are, we’re not alone
Even if it’s unfinished, I don’t mind
I really want to play it
Reach, truthfulness
We were finally able to meet, this is our TREASURE Heart Beat

We want to know…to live…to love
The countless prayers-
Make them heard, make them into wings, Can Fly High

We’ll sing, we’ll sing as long as we feel like it
No matter how quiet it is, it’s our single song in the world
I want to live with all my might
So much that I won’t regret it even if I die today
Release, passionate
This is a PRECIOUS Heart Beat of ours
We’ll sing, TREASURE Heart Beat
Listen!!
